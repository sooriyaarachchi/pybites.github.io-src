Title: Hone Your Python Skills
Status: hidden
save_as: index.html

Python is hot according to [Dice](https://insights.dice.com/2016/02/01/whats-hot-and-not-in-tech-skills/). It’s an easy language to learn, has an elegant design and is widely used. 

You might want to learn it. And we'd love to help you!

We are Bob and Julian, two Pythonistas passionate about learning and teaching Python.

Darren Hardy's advice in [The Compound Effect](https://www.amazon.com/dp/159315724X/?tag=pyb0f-20) resonated with us:
> To up your chances of success, get a success buddy, someone who’ll keep you accountable as you cement your new habit while you return the favor.

So we stopped just chatting about Python and took action. `datetime(year=2016, month=12, day=19)` [PyBites was born](https://pybit.es/special-building-pybites.html). Our five pillars are: [articles](https://pybit.es/pages/articles.html), [news](https://pybit.es/pages/news.html), ([live](https://pybit.es/alicante-pychallengeday.html)) [code challenges](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html), ['100 Days Of' projects](https://pybit.es/pages/projects.html) and [video courses](https://pybit.es/pages/courses.html).

We are strong believers in [Learning Python by Coding for Yourself](https://pybit.es/learn-by-doing.html) so we will have you hitting the ground running in no time by building projects. We have you challenging yourself which will make you come out stronger. You might even be surprised by what you are capable of. But for all the hard work we always try to add an element of fun :)
