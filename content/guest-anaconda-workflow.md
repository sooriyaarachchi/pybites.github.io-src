Summary: In this article Martin provides an easy-to-follow reference guide of his Anaconda workflow. He uses this to make his life easier managing the his Python environment and package dependencies. And to great avail as you will soon discover. Not only will you learn the basics of the powerful conda tool, he also goes into more depth on the more niche/advanced features like using alternate channels, distributing and cloning environments, and updating Anaconda. Warning: this might get you on Anaconda, and if you are already you probably want to keep this one nearby for reference.

# My Anaconda Workflow
I've been working with [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) for a while now and I've been relatively pleased with it. I'll admit, there was a bit of a learning curve at first, but hopefully I can get you past that initial hump with this write-up. There are lots of commands and covering them all is better done in the official [documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-cloud/user-guide/).

> What I've covered here is just what I use most often and should get you comfortable with using Anaconda.

## Create Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment with Anaconda is pretty simple. If you do not specify a Python version, whatever your current default one is will be used. Don't know your default version? Simple run `python --version` to find out.

Let's create one that uses Python 3.7 and is called pybites:

```
conda create --name pybites python=3.7
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/pybites

  added / updated specs:
    - python=3.7


The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:

The comments at the end show you how to activate/deactivate your new environment. I have an alias set in my shell's rc file that maps `activate` to `source activate` so that I don't have to type `source` all of the time.

## List Virtual Environments
Don't remember what you named your environment? Just what to see which ones you have created? You can view them all with `conda env list`. The name of the environment will be shown as well as its location:

```
conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/mohh/anaconda3
animpy                   /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/animpy
comic_snagger            /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/comic_snagger
cv                       /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/cv
ml                       /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/ml

toepack                  /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/toepack
```

<a name="remove_virtual_environment"></a>
## Remove Virtual Environment
If you ever have the need to remove an environment, `conda env remove --name ENVNAME` will remove it and every package installed in it:

```
conda env remove --name pybites

Remove all packages in environment /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/pybites:

## Search for Packages
Normally, before attempting to install a new package, I search for it to see if Anaconda supports it. I already know that *beautifulsoup4* is supported, but I'll go ahead and show you what that would look like:

```
conda search beautifulsoup4
Loading channels: done

<a name="install_packages"></a>
## Install Packages
Installing packages is simple. You can either install them into your current environment or you can specify the environment to install them into. If you are not currently in an "active"  environment, Anaconda will assume that you want to install to the *root*/**base** environment.

<a name="current_environment"></a>
### Current Environment
Installing to the current environment is as simple as:
```
conda install beautifulsoup4
```

<a name="other_environment"></a>
### Other Environment
If you are not currently in the active environment that you want to install to, you can still install into that environment by specifying its name:
```
conda install --name pybites beautifulsoup4
```

<a name="install_packages_not_found"></a>
## Installing Packages Not Found
A list of all available packages can be found at  [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs). Now, what do you do if the package that you want isn't available?

```
conda search black
Loading channels: done

PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - black

Current channels:

  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/free/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/free/noarch
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/pro/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/pro/noarch

To search for alternate channels that may provide the conda package you're
looking for, navigate to

    https://anaconda.org

and use the search bar at the top of the page.
```

<a name="search_alternate_channels"></a>
### Search Alternate Channels
As you can see `black` is not in Anaconda's default "channels". A channel is like a repository of packages. Anaconda allows you to specify different channels as well, with the use of the **-c** flag. For example:

```
conda search -c conda-forge black
Loading channels: done
# Name                  Version           Build  Channel             
black                    18.4a4            py_0  conda-forge         
black                    18.5b0            py_0  conda-forge         
black                    18.5b1            py_0  conda-forge         
black                    18.6b2            py_0  conda-forge
```

<a name="install_package_from_a_channel"></a>
#### Install Package From A Channel
You already know what the **Channel** column is showing you, so I won't cover that again. The **Version** column shows the version of the package and the **Build** column shows you what version of Python it's for. The cool thing about Anaconda is that if you need a certain version of a package, you just specify it and it will select the one that will work with the version of Python that you are currently using.

Installing packages from a channel is relatively similar to searching for packages. I'll demonstrate by installing `black` from the *condo-forge* channel:

```
conda install -c conda-forge black
Solving environment: done

### Add Additional Channels
If you would like to add a certain channel to the ones that are search by default, the following command will do:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

<a name="install_packages_with_pip"></a>
### Install Packages With Pip
I haven't added any channels to my setup. I'm only covering it here because it was mentioned on Slack. It's been my experience that the Anaconda packages usually lag behind a bit from what's bleeding edge. So If you still are not able to find a channel that has your package, or you just want to use a more up to date package, you can just install it with `pip`.

I searched for **black** with `pip search black` and discovered that the latest version of black available was *18.6b4*. The latest one in *conda-forge* at the time of this writing was *18.6b2*.

```
pip install black
```

<a name="remove_packages"></a>
## Remove Packages
> I forgot to mention it earlier when installing a package, but multiple packages can be installed at the same time, just like one or more can be removed at the same time.

Didn't use a package that you added and now want to remove it? Simple enough:

```
conda remove beautifulsoup4 black

The following packages will be UPDATED:

    openssl:         1.0.2o-0    conda-forge --> 1.0.2o-h20670df_0

The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:

    ca-certificates: 2018.4.16-0 conda-forge --> 2018.03.07-0

If you had previously added the *conda-forge* channel, `black` could have been specified as well. In this case, I would have to install it separately with `pip` so that I would be running the most recent one.

<a name="export_environment_configuration"></a>
## Export Environment Configuration
You've put a lot of work into creating the perfect environment. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to recreate the environment from a file, like `pip` does with requirements.txt? Anaconda has you covered! With `pip` you use `pip freeze` to create the file; with Anaconda its done with `conda env export`:

```
conda env export

```

> Notice how packages that are installed with *pip* are shown. Those all happen to be dependencies of black.

Just like the `pip` command, this must be *piped* into a text file. Anaconda uses the YAML format, so the command would be `conda env export > environment.yml`.

<a name="create_environment_from_yaml_file"></a>
## Create Environment From File
As it is, the *environemnt.yml* file can be used to recreate your environment on your platform and on your machine only. If you are in the directory with the YAML file, simply use `conda env create`. Anaconda will automatically detect the file and create it.

```
conda env create

<a name="prepare_environment_yaml_for_distribution"></a>
## Prepare Environment YAML For Distribution
As stated above, it's only good for your current machine. What if you want to share it with others or recreate it on another machine? You'll first have to edit the file:

* Remove the *prefix* line at the end of the file, since it's specific to your user name and file structure.
* Remove everything after the last `=` sign, to include the `=`, from the last parts of the package names.

Since a lot of the packages listed are dependencies of the packages that you've added, I normally remove them all and only leave the ones that I specifically installed myself. Not sure if that's best practice, but it's worked fine for me so far.

Once done, your file should look like this:

```
name: pybites
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - beautifulsoup4=4.6.0
  - pytest=3.6.3
  - python=3.7.0
  - requests=2.19.1
  - pip:
    - black==18.6b4
```

<a name="list_packages"></a>
## List Packages
To view what packages are installed in your environment `conda list` will get the job done:

> Note that you can also tell which were installed with pip.

```

## Clone An Environment
There might come a time when you have a need to clone an existing environment. I like to have an environment with all packages installed to play around with, so I clone the *base* environment. That way I can keep *base* vanilla, yet still be able to install any package that I want into the clone without messing anything up in *base*.

```
conda create --clone base --name ml
Source:      /home/mohh/anaconda3
Destination: /home/mohh/anaconda3/envs/ml
The following packages cannot be cloned out of the root environment:
 - conda-4.5.8-py36_0
 - conda-build-3.10.9-py36_0
 - conda-env-2.6.0-1
Packages: 259
Files: 68

Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate ml
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

If you do clone the *base* environment, you will get the above message about certain packages not being copied. It's completely normal and should not be displayed when cloning any other environment.

<a name="updates"></a>
## Updates
Updating Anaconda can be a confusing mess. You would think that using the GUI Navigator (`anaconda-navigator`) would be easier to use, but I haven't had much luck with it. It's clunky and slow.

Looking for instructions online is also a big fat mess. Everyone contradicts each other with their own opinions. I've tried several of them and this is what has worked for me.

Use the following commands in the order shown instead:

1. `conda update conda`
2. `conda update anaconda`
3. `conda update --all`

> NOTE: Make sure to read the messages that you get while updating anaconda. The last time I did it, I skipped it because it wanted to downgrade my version of Python from 3.6.6 to 3.6.5. It must have been to satisfy the dependency of one of the updated packages, so I skipped it and only ran steps `1` & `2`.

<a name="tl;dr"></a>
## TL;DR
**T**oo **L**ong**;** **D**int't **R**ead? I've got you covered!

| Task | Command |
| ----------- | -------:|
| Create virtual environment | `conda create --name ENVNAME` |
| List virtual environemnts | `conda env list` |
| Remove virtual environment | `conda env remove --name ENVNAME` |
| Search for packages | `conda search PACKAGENAME` |
| Install packages | `conda install PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2...` |
| Install package in other env | `conda install --name ENVNAME PACKAGENAME` |
| Search alternate channel | `conda search -c CHANNELNAME PACKAGENAME` |
| Install from channel | `conda install -c CHANNELNAME PACKAGENAME` |
| Add additional channel | `conda config --add channels CHANNELNAME` |
| Remove packages | `conda remove PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2...` |
| Create env and install packages | `conda create --name ENVNAME PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2...` |
| Export env config | `conda env export > environment.yml` |
| Create env from environment.yml | `conda env create` |
| List packages | `conda list` |
| Clone environment | `conda create --clone ORIGINALENV --name NEWENV` |
| Update conda | `conda update conda` |
| Update Anaconda | `conda update anaconda` |
| Update all packages | `conda update --all` |
