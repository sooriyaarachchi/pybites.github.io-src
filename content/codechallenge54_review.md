In this article we review last week's [Python Clipboard History](http://pybit.es/codechallenge54.html) code challenge. 

## Reminder: new structure review post / Hacktoberfest is back!

From now on we will merge our solution into our Community branch and include anything noteworthy here, because:

* we are learning just like you, we are all equals :)

* we _need_ the PRs too ;) ... as part of [Hacktoberfest No. 5](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) that just kicked of (5 PRs and you get a cool t-shirt)

_Don't be shy, share your work!_

## Community Pull Requests

### PCC54 Lessons

<!-- -->
> Refreshed pypeclip and sqlite modules. PyQT5 documentation is evolving. Hence there are not much code available in the public domain to play around with, which is a constraint in designing GUIs for Python apps using QT.

<!-- -->
> I had to really think about how to monitor the clipboard and copy the text from it just ONCE, ie, no immediate duplicates. It was more the thought process around it.

<!-- -->
> I learned some new things about tkinter

<!-- -->
> Gave me the chance to finally play with python 3.7's dataclasses, although not by much though.

<!-- -->
> Really nice one to practice various skills. I made a [clipboard cache queue](http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/clipper/clipper.mp4), a bit like vim buffers (used: deque, clear terminal, class, property, pyperclip, termcolor)

## Read Code for Fun and Profit

You can look at all submitted code [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and/or [on our Community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community).

Other learnings we spotted in Pull Requests for other challenges this week: 

> (PCC01) how `with` works in python

<!-- -->
> (PCC13) I tweaked your tests in order to make it pass with my data structure.

<!-- -->
> (PCC39) Played around with 'fixture' and the scope of the fixture.

<!-- -->
> (PCC47) This one was time consuming because I had to look up how to graph all of these, but it was an excellent learning exercise!

<!-- -->
> (PCC51) Expanded my skills of working with the databases within python and brushed up on some rusty SQL skills
