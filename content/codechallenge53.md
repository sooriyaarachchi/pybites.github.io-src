Hey Pythonistas,

We bet this one's going to be music to your ears (another quality pun!).

This week, query the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and write some code that performs the set of tasks we've listed below.

If you have another music service you'd rather use, feel free!

## The Challenge

Now for the challenge tasks: 

- [Query Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and grab a list of album names for any given artist. Bonus points if the script allows the user to specify the artist!

- Create a playlist on your account if you don't already have one. Write a script that queries Spotify for the playlist and returns all tracks/songs in the playlist.

- This one's tricky: write a script that obtains a list of the top tracks for an artist and see if any of those songs exist in your playlist.

- Feel free to dig into the API and go wild!

> If you don't have an existing playlist, just create one with random artists and use it as your data set.


**Hint**: Check out the [Spotipy Python Library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make this a little easier on yourself.
